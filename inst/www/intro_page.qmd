# Welcome to scExploreR! 

scExploreR allows for in-depth exploration of single-cell datasets without code. Functionality for the app is grouped into three tabs, the info tab, the plots tab, and the differential expression tab.

## Info Tab

The information tab is grouped into the following pages, which may be switched using the sidebar on the left:

- **General Information:** Information about the app (current page)
- **Dataset Information:** Information on the currently loaded dataset 
- **Dataset Metadata:** Information on metadata variables in the current dataset

## Plots Tab

Use the plots tab to produce and export several plot types commonly used in single-cell analysis. The following visualizations are available:

- DimPlots
- Feature Plots
- Feature Co-expression plots
- Violin Plots
- Dot Plots
- Scatterplots
- Ridge Plots
- Cell Type Proportion Plots

For more information on plot types, go to the "?" button and select "Single-Cell Visualizations". For information on all features in the plots tab, please see the [full documentation](https://amc-heme.github.io/scExploreR/articles/full_documentation.html#plots-tab). 

## Differential Expression Tab

Use the differential expression tab to identify genes that are upregulated or downregulated between groups of cells in the dataset. Currently, a Wilcoxon rank sum method is used, with plans to add pseudobulk testing in the near future.

### Running a Differential Expression Test

Use the menu on the left hand side of the app to run a differential gene expression test.

**Step 1: Choose test**

- **Differential expression:** Compare two cell groups to find genes enriched in one group versus the other.  
- **Marker identification:** Split cells into three or more groups to find genes enriched in each group versus all others.  

**Step 2: Define groups**  

- **By metadata:**  
  - **Differential expression:** Pick a categorical variable, then assign selected values to Group 1 and Group 2.  
  - **Marker identification:** Use every value as its own group.  
- **By feature expression (DE only):**  
  1. Select a feature.  
  2. Set an expression threshold via the interactive ridge plot.  
  3. Cells ≥ threshold → Group 1; cells < threshold → Group 2.  

**Step 3: Select analysis scope**  
- **Full object:** Run on all cells.  
- **Subset:** Apply filters (e.g., metadata or QC metrics), then run on the filtered cells.
