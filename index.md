# scExploreR

**Welcome to the single cell visualization tool you didn’t know you were
looking for!** This app is designed to make exploration of highly
complex data sets easy for anyone, regardless of informatics background.
Whether you’re a researcher looking to make sense of your single cell
data, or a bioinformatician looking to present your results
interactively, you will find value in this app. scExplorer bridges the
gap between domain (disease and clinical) specific knowledge and
informatics expertise by providing a no-code platform for biologists to
analyze data.

scExploreR further facilitates analysis through compatability with most
common single cell data formats! Seurat, SingleCellExpreiment, or
Anndata objects can be used, and Seurat v5 objects with BP Cells assays
are also supported.

Some bioinformatics experience is required to install the app and
configure each single-cell dataset, but once set up, the app can be used
by anyone.

## Requirements

- [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/install/)
- A pre-processed and finalized single cell object (or objects).
  Currently supported formats: Seurat, SingleCellExperiment, and
  Anndata.
- A server to host the app. This can be any computer with at that can be
  left on and be connected to the internet continuously. RAM
  requirements vary depending on the object type.

If using anndata objects,
[reticulate](https://github.com/rstudio/reticulate) must be installed
with the following Python packages:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scipy
- Anndata
- Scanpy

## Installation and Use

1.  Install from Github using
    [Remotes](https://github.com/r-lib/remotes).

&nbsp;

    remotes::install_github("amc-heme/scExploreR")

If this is your first time setting up scExploreR, we reccomend you view
the [**App Setup
Walkthrough**](https://amc-heme.github.io/scExploreR/articles/dataset_setup_walkthrough.html),
which applies the process in steps 3-5 to an example object.

2.  Process or obtain a finalized single cell object.

3.  Configure an object for the browser by using the configuration app
    provided with the package. For more information on the config app,
    see the [**Full Config App
    Documentation**](https://amc-heme.github.io/scExploreR/articles/config_documentation.html)
    or the [**App Setup
    Walkthrough**](https://amc-heme.github.io/scExploreR/articles/dataset_setup_walkthrough.html).

&nbsp;

    scExploreR::run_config(
      object_path = "path_to_your_seurat_object.rds",
      # The config path will be blank the first time you use the config app for an object
      config_path = "previously_loaded_config_file"
      )

4.  To set up a browser for others to use, create a browser config YAML
    file (If you are using the browser locally for your own use, skip to
    step 4). The file will contain a list of datasets with the path to
    the objects and config files for each, along with browser specific
    settings.

5.  Run scExploreR. There are multiple ways to do this:

- If setting up an app instance, use the path to your config file.

        scExploreR::run_scExploreR(
          browser_config = "./config.yaml"
          )

- If setting up locally, and if you only have one object, you may
  instead enter the path to your object and object-specific config file.

        scExploreR::run_scExploreR(
          object_path = "./object.rds"
          config_path = "./config.yaml"
          )

## Future Goals

- Additional analyses such as GSEA will be added in the future
- Explicit support for single cell data besides CITE-seq will be added.
