# Plots Tab {#plots-tab}

The plots tab is used to explore and summarize the data using several plot types. All plots may be created from either the full dataset or a subset of cells based on metadata. For more, see the subsetting section.

## Plot Switches

At the top of the options panel you will see several switches, one for each plot type. To show/hide each plot, click the switch. The available plot types are described briefly below, and each is described in more detail in their respective sections.

-   **DimPlot:** shows each cell on dimensional reduction plot, either a UMAP, or a set of other visualizations enabled by the browser admin.

-   **Feature Plot:** a DimPlot with cells colored by expression of a feature (gene, surface protein, or other data enabled by the browser admin).

-   **Violin Plot:** displays the distribution of expression of a feature across groups of cells in the sample.

-   **Dot Plot:** shows the average expression and extent of expression of multiple features across groups of cells in the sample.

-   **Scatterplot:** compares expression of two genes in a sample. All cells are plotted according to the expression value of each of the two features entered. Correlation between genes may be quantified in the [Gene Correlations Tab](#gene-correlations).

-   **Ridge Plot:** displays a density plot of the expression of a feature in all cells, or in groups of cells.

-   **Cell Proportion Plot:** used to visualize metadata. Shows the proportion of cells belonging to each value of a categorical metadata variable, and compares proportions across each value of a second categorical metadata variable.

-   **Metadata Pie Chart:** shows metadata at the sample/patient level. The pie chart displays the number of samples/patients in each categorical metadata value.

## Feature Selection {#feature-selection}

When plot types based on a gene or multiple genes are selected, the feature entry menu will display beneath the switches. Any gene in the dataset may be entered here. Surface proteins, gene signatures, and other data enabled by the user setting up the browser may also be entered in this menu.

## Palettes

## Subsets

## Dimensional Reduction Plots

Dimensional reduction plots are used to summarize overall gene expression in the sample (for more, see [Interpereting scRNA-seq plots](scRNA_Plots_Explained.html)). Cells with similar expression profiles tend to cluster next to each other, but quantitative connections can't necessarily be made between distance on the plot and similarity in gene expression (i.e. a cell that is 16 units away from another cell is not twice as dissimilar from a cell that is 8 units away).

#### Metadata to Group By

This menu is used to select a categorical metadata variable to be used to coloring cells. Cells will be colored according to their associated metadata for the variable chosen, and the key for colors used will display in the legend to the right.

#### Metadata to Split By

This menu sets a categorical metadata variable used to "split" cells into separate plots for viewing side-by-side. One panel will be created for each value in the split by variable, and cells will display on the panel corresponding to the metadata value for that cell.

This menu is useful for comparing projections between different metadata. For example, transcriptional differences between patients can be quickly spotted when splitting by patient. A patient may be missing a certain cell type, or have a different proportion of cells compared to other patients. Differences spotted in this selection can be analyzed in more detail in the differential gene expression and correlations tabs. This menu defaults to "None".

When a variable is selected, a slider to choose the number of columns will appear under the "Title options menu" (see [Choose number of columns](#choose-number-of-columns) for more info).

#### Choose Projection

This menu is used to switch between different methods of dimensional reduction: cells are plotted according to the coordinates selected in the current projection method. Projection methods are added by the user setting up the browser, and the default projection is chosen by that user. Common projections include UMAP and t-SNE. For more information on each projection included with the current dataset, contact the user or organization that set up the browser.

#### Title Options

The title options menu is used to change or remove the title of the dimensional reduction plot. When set to "Default" the title shown is the name of the selected group by metadata variable. When set to "Custom", an interface will appear beneath the menu to enter a custom title. Press "Update" to apply changes to the title, and "Reset" to revert the title to the default.

![](Screenshots/scExplorer_all_features/custom_title_menu.png){.centered-image style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="336"}

#### Choose Number of Columns {#choose-number-of-columns}

This setting applies to split plots only, and remains hidden until a selection is made in the "Choose Metadata to Split by" menu. Drag the slider to specify the number of columns to use when displaying the panels of a split plot. Possible values may be anywhere from 1 to the number of panels created by the current split by variable.

![](Screenshots/scExplorer_all_features/numer_of_columns.png){.centered-image width="460"}

#### Label Groups

When checked, labels will display above each cluster of cells according to the currently selected group by variable.

#### Include Legend

When checked, the legend will display to the right-hand side of the plot. when unchecked, the legend will be removed.

#### Manually Adjust Plot Dimensions

When enabled, an interface appears allowing the user to change the height and width of the plot. The height and width are entered in pixels, and may be chosen using the slider or the text box. When entering a value in the text box, press return to update the plot with the value. Downloaded plots will have the dimensions defined here, if "manually adjust plot dimensions" is checked.

#### Download Button

To download plots, press the download button at the bottom left hand side of the "DimPlot Specific Options" menu. A menu will appear with an option to choose whether to download a .png or .svg file, and a download button will appear beneath that button. Downloads in the .svg format can be edited with Adobe Illustrator or a similar program to add additional labels or modify the text or colors of the plot. All graphical elements added to the plot can be edited individually in an .svg editor.

## Feature Plots

Feature plots are dimensional reduction plots that are colored according to feature expression instead of categorical metadata. Among other things, feature plots can be used to see which cell types are expressing a feature and to what extent, or to visualize differences in expression between treatment groups when a split by metadata variable is selected.

```
#### Metadata to Split By

This menu sets a categorical metadata variable used to "split" cells into separate plots for viewing side-by-side. One panel will be created for each value in the split by variable. If a single feature is entered in the [feature selection](#feature-selection) menu, the number of columns used for the panels may be adjusted. If two or more features are entered, however, the layout is fixed to place features by row and split by groups by column.

#### Choose Projection

This menu is used to switch between different methods of dimensional reduction: cells are plotted according to the coordinates selected in the current projection method. Projection methods are added by the user setting up the browser, and the default projection is chosen by that user. Common projections include UMAP and t-SNE. For more information on each projection included with the current dataset, contact the user or organization that set up the browser.

#### Title Options

The title options menu is used to change or remove the titles appearing above each panel of the feature plot. When set to "default", the titles shown are equal to the feature (if one feature or multiple features are entered without a split by variable), or to the values in the split by metadata variable when one feature is entered with a split by variable. When set to "none", no titles are shown.

The "Custom" option is available in all settings except for when multiple features are entered and a split by variable is chosen. When set to "custom", an interface will appear to customize titles for every panel displayed on the screen. Enter values and press "Update" to apply changes to the title. The `r icon("redo-alt")` buttons to the right of each title entry will revert that individual title to the default. Pressing "Reset" will revert the titles for all panels to the default.

#### Display Options for Legend Title

Used to control the title that displays above the legend to the right. When set to "Feature Name" (the default), the feature name will display above the legend. When set to "Expression", the legend will be set to "Expression". If "No Title" is selected, the title will be removed. This menu is hidden when multiple features are entered and a split by variable is chosen. In this case, no title will display above the legend.

#### Choose Number of Columns

This setting is available when one feature is selected with a split by variable, or when multiple features are chosen without a split by variable.

Drag the slider to specify the number of columns to distribute the panels across. Possible values may be anywhere from 1 to the number of panels. This setting is not available when feature co-expression is enabled.

![](Screenshots/scExplorer_all_features/numer_of_columns.png){.centered-image width="460"}

#### Share Scale Between Features

This setting is available when multiple features are entered with no split by variable. When enabled, all features will be plotted using the same scale. When disabled, each feature is plotted using a scale defined by the minimum and maximum expression values for that feature. This setting must be enabled to properly compare expression between different features.

#### Display Feature Name Above Panels

This setting is available when one feature is entered and split by metadata is provided. When enabled, the feature name will display centered above the panels created from the split by variable.

#### Order Cells by Expression

When checked, cells with the highest expression values will be plotted on top of the cells with lower expression values. When unchecked (the default), cells will be plotted in random order. Enabling this setting can help with features that are expressed in only a few cells in the sample, but when used with features that are expressed in many cells but with a low average expression, the extent of expression in the sample may be exaggerated. To avoid this, we recommend that feature plots be used alongside other means of visualization for expression, such as [violin plots](#violin-plots), [dot plots](#dot-plots), and [ridge plots](#ridge-plots).

#### Label Groups

When checked, labels will display above each cluster of cells according to the currently selected group by variable.

#### Include Legend

When checked, the legend will display to the right-hand side of the plot. when unchecked, the legend will be removed.

#### Manually Adjust Plot Dimensions

When enabled, an interface appears allowing the user to change the height and width of the plot. The height and width are entered in pixels, and may be chosen using the slider or the text box. When entering a value in the text box, press return to update the plot with the value. Downloaded plots will have the dimensions defined here, if "manually adjust plot dimensions" is checked.

#### Download Button

To download plots, press the download button at the bottom left hand side of the "Feature Plot Specific Options" menu. A menu will appear with an option to choose whether to download a .png or .svg file, and a download button will appear beneath that button. Downloads in the .svg format can be edited with Adobe Illustrator or a similar program to add additional labels or modify the text or colors of the plot. All graphical elements added to the plot can be edited individually in an .svg editor.

## Violin Plots {#violin-plots}

`# TODO: General description`

#### Metadata for Primary Groups

The categorical metadata variable chosen here will determine how cells are grouped. One violin plot will be drawn for each unique value in the chosen metadata variable.

#### Metadata for Secondary Grouping

A second categorical variable may be supplied for more in-depth comparison of groups. When specified, violins for each combination between the values of the primary and secondary metadata variable will be drawn. Violins will be colored according to the secondary variable, and split according to the primary variable (see example below). In general, the plot can be used to compare distributions for each value of the primary variable between each value of the secondary variable.

[ADD IMAGE]

#### Order of Groups on Plot

Sets the order groups specified by the primary metadata selection appear on the plot. When set to "ascending", values in the primary metadata variable will display in alphanumeric order, from A to Z. When set to "descending", values will display in reverse alphanumeric order. When set to "custom", an interface will appear that will allow you to arrange values in any order. To change the order of a value, drag-and-drop the value in the interface.

#### Number of Columns

This setting is available when multiple features have been entered.

Drag the slider to specify the number of columns to distribute the panels across. Possible values may be anywhere from 1 to the number of panels. This setting is not available when feature co-expression is enabled.
