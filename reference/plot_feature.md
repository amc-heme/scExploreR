# Visualize 'features' on a dimensional reduction plot

Colors single cells on a dimensional reduction plot according to a
'feature' (i.e. gene expression, PC scores, number of genes detected,
etc.)

## Usage

``` r
plot_feature(
  object,
  features,
  label_by = NULL,
  dims = c(1, 2),
  cells = NULL,
  cols = if (blend) {
     c("lightgrey", "#ff0000", "#00ff00")
 } else {
    
    c("lightgrey", "blue")
 },
  pt_size = NULL,
  order = FALSE,
  min_cutoff = NA,
  max_cutoff = NA,
  reduction = NULL,
  split_by = NULL,
  keep_scale = "feature",
  shape_by = NULL,
  slot = NULL,
  blend = FALSE,
  blend_threshold = 0.5,
  label = FALSE,
  label_size = 4,
  label_color = "black",
  repel = FALSE,
  ncol = NULL,
  coord_fixed = FALSE,
  by_col = TRUE,
  combine = TRUE,
  raster = NULL,
  raster_dpi = c(512, 512)
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  a Seurat object or a SingleCellExperiment object

- features:

  Vector of features to plot. Features can come from: - An `Assay`
  feature (e.g. a gene name - "MS4A1") - A column name from meta.data
  (e.g. mitochondrial percentage - "percent.mito") - A column name from
  a `DimReduc` object corresponding to the cell embedding values (e.g.
  the PC 1 scores - "PC_1")

- label_by:

  A metadata column used for labeling groups on the featute plot, if
  label is `TRUE`.

- dims:

  Dimensions to plot, must be a two-length numeric vector specifying x-
  and y-dimensions i.e. c(1,2) to plot the first and second dimensions
  from the reduction results.

- cells:

  Vector of cells to plot (default is all cells)

- cols:

  The two colors to form the gradient over. Provide as string vector
  with the first color corresponding to low values, the second to high.
  Also accepts a Brewer color scale or vector of colors. Note: this will
  bin the data into number of colors provided. When blend is `TRUE`,
  takes anywhere from 1-3 colors:

  - 1 color:

    - Treated as color for double-negatives, will use default colors 2
      and 3 for per-feature expression

  - 2 colors:

    - Treated as colors for per-feature expression, will use default
      color 1 for double-negatives

  - 3+ colors:

    - First color used for double-negatives, colors 2 and 3 used for
      per-feature expression, all others ignored

- pt_size:

  Adjust point size for plotting

- order:

  Boolean determining whether to plot cells in order of expression. Can
  be useful if cells expressing given feature are getting buried.

- min_cutoff, max_cutoff:

  Vector of minimum and maximum cutoff values for each feature, may
  specify quantile in the form of 'q##' where '##' is the quantile (eg,
  'q1', 'q10')

- reduction:

  Which dimensionality reduction to use. If not specified, first
  searches for umap, then tsne, then pca

- split_by:

  A metadata column to split the feature plot by. Unlike
  [`Seurat::FeaturePlot`](https://satijalab.org/seurat/reference/FeaturePlot.html),
  "ident" may not be passed since the ident functionality is not
  supported by SingleCellExperiment objects. A metadata column name must
  be passed, or `NULL` to disable split plots.

- keep_scale:

  How to handle the color scale across multiple plots. Options are:

  - `feature` (default; by row/feature scaling):

    - The plots for each individual feature are scaled to the maximum
      expression of the feature across the conditions provided to
      'split_by'.

  - `all` (universal scaling):

    - The plots for all features and conditions are scaled to the
      maximum expression value for the feature with the highest overall
      expression.

  - `NULL` (no scaling):

    - Each individual plot is scaled to the maximum expression value of
      the feature in the condition provided to 'split_by'. Be aware
      setting NULL will result in color scales that are not comparable
      between plots.

- shape_by:

  If NULL, all points are circles (default). You can specify any cell
  attribute (that can be pulled with fetch_data) allowing for both
  different colors and different shapes on cells. Only applicable if
  `raster = FALSE`.

- slot:

  Which slot to pull expression data from? If `NULL`, defaults to "data"
  for Seurat objects, and "logcounts" for SingleCellExperiment objects.

- blend:

  Scale and blend expression values to visualize co-expression of two
  features

- blend_threshold:

  The color cutoff from weak signal to strong signal; ranges from 0 to
  1.

- label:

  Whether to label the clusters

- label_size:

  Sets size of labels

- label_color:

  Sets the color of the label text

- repel:

  Repel labels

- ncol:

  Number of columns to combine multiple feature plots to, ignored if
  `split_by` is not `NULL`

- coord_fixed:

  Plot cartesian coordinates with fixed aspect ratio

- by_col:

  If splitting by a factor, plot the splits per column with the features
  as rows; ignored if `blend = TRUE`

- combine:

  Combine plots into a single
  [`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/patchwork-package.html)`ed`
  ggplot object. If `FALSE`, return a list of ggplot objects

- raster:

  Convert points to raster format, default is `NULL` which automatically
  rasterizes if plotting more than 100,000 cells

- raster_dpi:

  Pixel resolution for rasterized plots, passed to geom_scattermore().
  Default is c(512, 512).

## Value

A
[`patchwork`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/patchwork-package.html)`ed`
ggplot object if `combine = TRUE`; otherwise, a list of ggplot objects
