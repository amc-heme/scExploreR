# DataExploreShiny

<br>

*Welcome to the single cell visualization tool you didn't know you were looking for!* This app is designed to make exploration of highly complex data sets easy for anyone, regardless of informatics background. Bridging the gap between domain (disease and clinical) specific knowledge and high level sequencing data is possible with this tool, and ultimately makes the best use of these precious data sets to glean molecular and translational insights through democratizing analysis. 

## Requirements

<br>

* a pre-processed and finalized Seurat object (or a set of finalized objects)
* a version of this app, with your objects entered in the startup code (see ____ below for more information)
* installation of both the object and that app to our remote server

Some bioinformatics experience is required to install and configure the app, but once set up, the app can be used by anyone.

<br>

## How to Install

<br>



## Future Goals

<br>

<!-- As stated above, the current version of the app requires manually fitting each new object to its own specific version of the app. Future versions of the app will be able to accept *any* Seurat object, automatically detect (or user specified) metadata values of interest, and build the app to provide exploration of that object. 

<br>

A more advanced version of this app will not only accept Seurat objets, but also Scanpy.
