# scExploreR Walkthrough

This tutorial will guide you through the use of scExploreR to analyze your data. This is not a comprehensive exploration of each feature: for more information on any feature, see the [full documentation]().

Key functionality is grouped into three tabs: plots, differential expression, and gene correlations. The interface on each tab displays the plots and analysis results on the right, and the options on the left hand panel (referred to in this document as the options panel).

# Data Visualization

When opening the app, the plots tab will display. The plots tab is the recommended starting point for analysis. It is useful for gaining a qualitative overview of the dataset as a jumping off point for analysis in the other tabs, and it can also be used to visualize the results generated in analysis-specific tabs.

At the top of the options panel you will see several switches, one for each plot type. To show/hide each plot, click the switch.

## Dimensional Reduction Plots

Dimensional reduction plots are used to summarize overall gene expression data in the sample (for more, see [Interpereting scRNA-seq plots](scRNA_Plots_Explained.html)).

The cells in the plot are colored by membership in each group of a categorical metadata variable. To change the variable used to color the cells, go to **DimPlot Specific Options -\> Metadata to Group by**.

### Split plots by a Metadata Variable

Dimensional reduction plots may be split by a categorical metadata variable to compare the gene expression summary across different values of the variable. For example, the gif below shows how to view a separate dimensional reduction plot for each patient. Variables may be chosen via **DimPlot Specific Options -\> Metadata to Split by**.

### Choose Projection

If the user setting up the browser has added multple projection methods to the current dataset, they may by chosen from **DimPlot Specific Options -\> Choose Projection.** There are numerous means of projecting data, the UMAP being the most common for scRNA-seq data. For more information on the projections included, please contact the user who set up the browser.

### Customizing Plots

Plots in scExplorer may be easily customized for display in presentations or manuscripts. This vignette will explore the options available for dimensionality reduction plots.

#### Plot Title

The title of the dimensional reduction plot defaults to the name of the selected group by metadata variable. This may be set to any value desired, and it may also be removed from the plot. To set a custom title, go to **DimPlot Specific Options -\> Choose Projection -\> Custom**. When this option is selected, a box will display beneath the menu where a custom title may be entered. To apply the title, press Update.
