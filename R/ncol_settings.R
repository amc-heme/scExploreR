#' ncol_limits
#'
#' Determines the min and max settings for the ncol slider for DimPlots, feature
#' plots, and violin plots based on selections made by the user in scExploreR.
#'
#' @param object A single cell object (any object class supported by SCUBA
#' may be entered).
#' @param rule The means of calculating ncol limits, depending on the plot type.
#' This can be either "split_by" (for DimPlots and feature plots), or "features"
#' (for violin plots).
#' @param split_by If rule == "split_by", the current split_by selection.
#' @param features_entered If rule == "features", the number of features 
#' currently entered.
#'
#' @return A three element vector. The elements are as follows:
#' 1. Minimum ncol selection
#' 2. Maximum ncol selection
#' 3. Default ncol value
