#shiny_umap

#Accepts inputs from plots_selections module and outputs a Seurat DimPlot from 
#the Seurat object passed to it. 

# object: a Seurat object. This can be either the full object or a subset.
# group_by: user specified group_by metadata category
# split_by: user specified split_by metadata category
# show_label: user choice as to whether labels should be shown on the plot
# show_legend: user choice as to whether a legend should be shown
# ncol: number of columns, as specified by user
# is_subset: reactive boolean value stating whether the object is a subset
# original_limits: user choice as to whether original axes limits should be used
# xlim_orig: the original x limits for the plot, computed from the full object at 
# app startup
# ylim_orig: the original y limits for the umap, computed from full object at 
# app startup
