#' Re-label axis behavior
#'
#' Code to relabel the axis in the expr_plot function. The default axis text is
#' "Feature Expression", and it changes or is removed based on the type of data
#' being plotted. If the data is a reduction, the label changes to "Embeddings
#' Value". If the data comes from a source that is not an assay or a reduction,
#' the label is removed. The label changed (x-axis or y-axis) depends on the
#' type of plot being created by expr_plot (violin, dot, etc.).
#'
#' For Anndata objects, the label will always show as "Feature Expression",
#' unless the feature plotted is a metadata variable, in which case no label
#' will be drawn.
#'
#' Labels can be manually added after plot creation with ggplot2::labs() in the
#' event a different label is more appropriate for the feature being plotted.
#'
#' @param object a single-cell object. Currently, Seurat,
#' SingleCellExperiment, Anndata, and MuData objects are supported.
#' @param feature the feature being plotted. Only one feature should be passed
#' to this generic at once. For multi-feature plot, this generic should be ran
#' separately on each feature, and the changes in labeling applied to each
#' individual plot (patchwork object) iteratively.
